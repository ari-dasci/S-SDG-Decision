The paper presents a Decision Making model in which from a set of questionnaries filled by experts in AI and SDGs we order different recommendations about AI related technologies that can be adopted in order to ease the fulfilment of those SDGs.

The model is based on fuzzy preference relations which are obtained from the crisp recommendations given by the experts. Finally a Quantifier Guided Dominance Degree and a Quantifier Guided Non Dominanced Degree are obtained in order to rank the different alternatives.

Moreover in this repository the original data used in the computations is also included.
